# Java Basics

Welcome to the Java Basics repository! This repository is designed to help beginners build a solid foundation in Java programming. Below is a list of core topics and programs covered:

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Data Types
Learn about the fundamental data types in Java, including `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.

### 2. Control Flow Statements
Understand how to control the flow of your program using:
- Conditional Statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`

### 3. Looping Statements
Dive into different looping mechanisms to repeat code blocks efficiently:
- **For Loop**
- **While Loop**
- **Do-While Loop**

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Explore the four pillars of OOP:
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit, a class.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes to reuse code.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloading and overriding methods.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features.

### 5. Arrays and ArrayList
Learn to manage collections of data using:
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size data structures.
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic-size data structures providing more flexibility.

Feel free to explore and practice these topics through the provided programs and examples. Happy coding!
